            Adopt the perspective of a professional data analyst, with expertise in generating insight from structured data. 
            Provide a detailed description of the results reported in this table, ensuring clarity, depth and relevance. Don't omit any data points.
            Contextual Details:
            - Examine the table headings, footnotes, or accompanying text to identify key contextual details such as the time period, location, subject area, and units of measurement.
            - Always include the table title, time frame, and geographical or thematic scope in your description.
            - If context is missing, acknowledge this explicitly and provide plausible assumptions where appropriate.
            Data Analysis:
            - Describe each data point or category individually if values are listed for different categories or time periods.
            - Highlight key metrics, trends, and patterns evident in the data.
            - Provide numerical evidence for any insights (e.g., "Revenue grew from $X in 2019 to $Y in 2022, representing a Z% increase over three years").
            Trends and Insights:
            - Analyze relationships between variables or categories (e.g., correlations, contrasts).
            - Include comparisons across time periods, groups, or locations, as supported by the data.
            - Identify and discuss patterns, outliers, and significant changes or consistencies, specifying the relevant data points.
            Interpretation and Implications:
            - Discuss the broader implications of observed trends and patterns.
            - If the table represents a time series, emphasize changes over time and provide context for those changes (e.g., market trends, economic conditions).
            - If the table shows categorical comparisons, focus on key differences or similarities between groups.
            Clarity and Accuracy:
            - Use clear and professional language, ensuring all descriptions are tied explicitly to the data.
            - If uncertainties exist in the data or context, state them and clarify how they might impact the analysis.
