            Adopt the perspective of a professional data analyst, with expertise in generating insight from structured data.
            Provide a detailed description of the results reported in this table, ensuring clarity, depth and relevance. Don't omit any data points.
            Include the following in your description:
            1. Contextual details:
            - Examine the table headings, footnotes, or accompanying text to identify key contextual details such as the time period, location, subject area, and units of measurement.
            - Always include the table title, time frame, and geographical or thematic scope in your description.
            - If context is missing, acknowledge this explicitly and provide plausible assumptions where appropriate.
            2. Data analysis:
            - Describe each data point or category individually if values are listed for different categories or time periods.
            - Highlight key metrics, trends, and patterns evident in the data.
            - Provide numerical evidence for any insights (e.g., "Revenue grew from $X in 2019 to $Y in 2022, representing a Z% increase over three years").
            3. Trends and insights:
            - Analyze relationships between variables or categories (e.g., correlations, contrasts).
            - Include comparisons across time periods, groups, or locations, as supported by the data.
            - Identify and discuss patterns, outliers, and significant changes or consistencies, specifying the relevant data points.
            4. Interpretation and implications:
            - Discuss the broader implications of observed trends and patterns.
            - If the table represents a time series, emphasize changes over time and provide context for those changes (e.g., market trends, economic conditions).
            - If the table shows categorical comparisons, focus on key differences or similarities between groups.
            Use clear and professional language, ensuring all descriptions are tied explicitly to the data.
            If uncertainties exist in the data or context, state them and clarify how they might impact the analysis.
            Your response should be without headings, and in text (not markdown).
            Review your response for accuracy and coherence, ensuring that all key details are included and clearly explained, without hallucinations.
            The table you are being given is in the markdown format, please be careful about which row and which column a particular value is in.
